				<h2>VROOM</h2>
				<p>Urban air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges faced by modern cities.
					Among the various sources of pollution, road traffic is widely assumed to be a primary contributor.
					In cities like Milan and Bologna—both characterized by dense traffic and periodic air quality
					alerts—it seems intuitive to link vehicle circulation directly to the deterioration of air quality.
					However, while this correlation is often taken for granted in public discourse and policy-making,
					there is a surprising lack of concrete, data-driven evidence to support it in a structured and
					comparative way.</p>
				<p>This project, carried out as part of the Open Access and Digital Ethics course at the University of
					Bologna, aims to investigate the relationship between the number and types of vehicles on the road
					and air quality levels in Milan and Bologna. By combining traffic data (including vehicle counts and
					categories) with historical air pollution measurements, we intend to analyze whether a statistically
					significant correlation exists, and if so, how it varies across different urban contexts and
					pollutants. The goal is to move beyond assumptions and provide empirical insights that can inform
					more effective environmental and mobility policies.

						<p>To carry out our analysis, we relied on a set of core datasets from which we extracted
							various subsets tailored to our specific needs. These main datasets — <b>Open Data - Comune
								di Bologna, I numeri di Bologna metropolitana,</b> and <b>Open Data - Comune di
								Milano</b> — provided the foundational data necessary to explore and address the
							objectives of our study. </p>

						<p>As part of our work, we conducted several complementary analyses to evaluate the datasets
							from different perspectives. These included a <b>quality analysis</b> to assess the
							reliability and completeness of the data, a <b>legal analysis</b> to examine licensing and
							usage rights, an <b>ethics analysis</b> to consider potential implications and biases, a
							<b>technical analysis</b> to evaluate data formats and accessibility, and an assessment of
							the <b>sustainability of dataset updates</b> to understand how regularly and reliably the
							data is maintained.
